    {
        question: "What exactly is UI/UX Design",
        answer: "UI/UX design stands for User Interface/User Experience design. UI design focuses on the look and layout of a digital product, such as a website or app, ensuring it's visually appealing and easy to navigate. UX design, on the other hand, concentrates on the overall experience users have with the product, aiming to make it intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable. In essence, UI/UX design combines aesthetics and functionality to create seamless and user-friendly digital experiences."

        question: "Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time designer? ",
        answer: "Great question!  Building a design team can be expensive. Hiring a full-time senior designer can easily cost over $100,000 per year with benefits, and finding available talent can be tough.  Even then, you might not always have enough work to keep them busy throughout the year, which means you'd be paying for unused time. With a monthly design subscription, you get the flexibility you need.  You can easily scale your design resources up or down depending on your project workload. This way, you only pay for design expertise when you truly need it. It's like having an on-demand design team, without the overhead costs of hiring full-time employees."

    {
        question: "How fast will I receive my designs?",
        answer: "On average, most requests are completed in just two days or less. However, more complex requests can take longer."
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a limit to how many requests I can have? ",
        answer: "Once subscribed, you're able to add as many requests to your queue as you'd like, and they will be delivered one by one."
    },
    {
        question: "Who are the designers?",
        answer: "You might be surprised to hear this, but Growthlobby is actually an agency of one. This means you'll work directly with me, founder of Growthlobby. However, power-ups requests such as backend implementation request or custom illustrations are provided by partner designers and developers."

    {
        question: "How does the pause feature work?",
        answer: "We understand you may not have enough design work or development requests to fill up entire month. Perhaps you only have one or two requests at the moment. That's where pausing your subscription comes in handy. Billing cycles are based on 31 day period. Let's say you sign up and use the service for 21 days, and then decide to pause your subscription. This means that the billing cycle will be paused and you'll have 10 days of service remaining to be used anytime in the future."
    },
    {
        question: "What programs do you design in?",
        answer: "As a designer that codes, most design requests are designed using Figma. I also use no-code tools like framer to build my designs faster. I can also build the site from scratch using the latest front end technologies."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I request designs?",
        answer: "Growthlobby offers a ton of flexibility in how you request designs using Trello. Some common ways clients request designs is directly via Trello, sharing Google docs or wireframes, or even recording a brief Loom or google meet video (for those who prefer not to write their briefs out). Basically, if it can be linked to or shared in Trello, it's fair game."
    },
    {
        question: "Is there any design work you don't cover?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Growthlobby does not cover the following design work: 3D modeling, animated graphics (GIFS, etc.), document design (medical forms, etc.), complex packaging, and extensive print design (magazines, books, etc.)."

    {
        question: "Are there any refunds if I don't like the service? ",
        answer: "Due to the high quality nature of the work, there will be no refunds issued."
